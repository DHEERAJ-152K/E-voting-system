The recent development in the area of voting system includes Blockchain technology, which 
not only proved to be time and cost efficient but is also safe and secure, hence is more reliable 
and precise than the earlier approaches. In this paper we have used blockchain based e- voting 
using smart contract which includes a set of rules governing the communication and decision 
on the contract between parties. Various tools like Ganache, Truffle framework, NPM and meta
mask were used for implementation purpose. As blockchain technology is decentralized due to 
which tempering and alteration in such system is quite attainable. Our proposed system 
provides convenience to the voters by allowing them to connect to the system having easy-touse user interface,
through which they can cast their vote by importing their account and can 
easily review their vote. It creates a sense of trust among voters, that their vote is being 
computed and kept in a safe custody.
